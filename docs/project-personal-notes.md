## Scroll-Driven Animations Implementation

### Goal

Create a smooth scroll-driven animation in the header where "Daniel Scheigert" condenses to "DS" as the user scrolls down the page.

### The Challenge: CSS Scroll-Driven Animations vs Tailwind CSS

**Problem Encountered:**

- Modern CSS scroll-driven animations (`animation-timeline: scroll()`) were not working despite Chrome 138 supporting them
- CSS was being crossed out in DevTools with warning triangles
- `CSS.supports('animation-timeline', 'scroll()')` returned `true`, confirming browser support

**Root Cause:**
Tailwind CSS was processing and interfering with the scroll-driven animation CSS, preventing the browser from recognizing the new syntax properly.

**Solutions Attempted:**

1. ‚úÖ **Inline `<style>` tags** - This worked! Bypassed Tailwind processing entirely
2. ‚ùå **External CSS files** (animations.css, globals.css) - All processed by Tailwind
3. ‚ùå **@supports feature detection** - Still processed by Tailwind
4. ‚ùå **Different syntax variations** (`scroll(root)`, `scroll(root block)`) - Same issue

**Final Implementation:**

```jsx
<style>{`
  .scroll-name-fade {
    animation: simple-fade linear both;
    animation-timeline: scroll();
    animation-range: 0 150px;
  }
  .s-letter {
    animation: s-slide linear both;
    animation-timeline: scroll();
    animation-range: 150px 200px;
  }
`}</style>
```

### Key Learnings

1. **Build Tool Interference**: Modern CSS features may work in browsers but fail due to build tool processing
2. **Inline CSS as Workaround**: Sometimes the "wrong" approach (inline styles) is the practical solution
3. **Progressive Enhancement Testing**: Always test new CSS features in isolation before integrating with frameworks
4. **Animation Sequencing**: Used separate animation ranges to create multi-stage effects:
    - 0-150px: Fade out letters
    - 150-200px: Slide "S" closer to "D"

### Technical Details

**Animation Breakdown:**

- "Daniel Scheigert" ‚Üí "D S" (letters fade out)
- "D S" ‚Üí "DS" (S slides left to close the gap)

**Browser Support:**

- Works in Chrome 138+
- Requires feature detection for production use
- Fallback: JavaScript-based scroll listeners

## Typography System Integration

### Font Setup

- **Sans-serif**: Inter (UI elements, headers)
- **Serif**: Lora (body text, reading content)
- **Monospace**: JetBrains Mono (code blocks)

### Challenge: Font Loading with Next.js

**Issue**: Font variables not being recognized when referenced from CSS variables
**Solution**: Define fonts directly in CSS rather than referencing Next.js font variables

### Custom Typography Classes

Implemented responsive typography system using CSS custom properties with clamp() for fluid scaling.

## View Transitions API Implementation Attempt

### Goal

Implement smooth page transitions using the modern View Transitions API for navigation between pages (Home, About, Projects).

### The Challenge: Next.js Compatibility Issues

**Problem Encountered:**

- View Transitions API appears to be partially supported but doesn't work properly with Next.js 15
- `document.startViewTransition()` executes and reaches "ready" state but CSS animations don't apply
- Transition reaches "finished" state without visible animation effects
- Issue persists regardless of using inline `style` attributes or CSS classes for `view-transition-name`

**Browser Support Confirmed:**

- `document.startViewTransition` exists and is callable
- Meta tag `<meta name="view-transition" content="same-origin" />` properly added
- All transition lifecycle events fire (ready, finished)

**Solutions Attempted:**

1. ‚ùå **Inline `style` attributes** - `style={{ viewTransitionName: 'main-content' }}`
2. ‚ùå **CSS classes** - `.main-content { view-transition-name: main-content; }`
3. ‚ùå **Router navigation** - Using `router.push()` instead of `window.location.href`
4. ‚ùå **Extended animation duration** - Set to 5 seconds to ensure visibility
5. ‚ùå **Multiple debugging approaches** - Console logging all transition events

**Root Cause Analysis:**

The View Transitions API is extremely new (2023) and Next.js doesn't have built-in support yet. The API expects standard browser navigation but Next.js uses custom client-side routing that may interfere with the transition capture/playback process.

**Current Status:**

‚ùå **Abandoned** - View Transitions API incompatible with Next.js 15
‚úÖ **Keeping project-level transitions** - Segmented control animations work fine for component-level transitions

### Key Learnings

1. **Cutting-Edge APIs**: Very new browser APIs often lack framework support
2. **Framework Limitations**: Even when browsers support a feature, SPA frameworks may have compatibility issues
3. **Transition Scope**: Component-level transitions work better than page-level transitions in SPAs
4. **Alternative Approaches**: Consider libraries like Framer Motion for complex animations in React

### Potential Future Solutions

- **Next.js Updates**: Wait for official View Transitions support
- **Third-party Libraries**: Explore `next-view-transitions` or similar packages
- **Custom Implementation**: Build page transition system using Framer Motion
- **Gradual Enhancement**: Implement for simple cases first, complex routing later

### Technical Implementation Details

**What Works:**

```jsx
// Component-level view transitions (like segmented control)
document.startViewTransition(() => {
    setSelectedSection(section);
});
```

**What Doesn't Work:**

```jsx
// Page-level navigation transitions
document.startViewTransition(() => {
    router.push('/about');
});
```

## CSS Anchor Positioning Implementation

### Goal

Create a smooth animated underline that follows hovered navigation links using the cutting-edge CSS Anchor Positioning API.

### The Challenge: Bleeding Edge Browser Features

**Implementation Journey:**

CSS Anchor Positioning is an experimental feature (2023) that allows elements to position themselves relative to other "anchor" elements anywhere in the DOM, breaking traditional parent-child positioning constraints.

**Key Concepts Learned:**

- **`anchor-name`**: Creates a named anchor point on an element
- **`anchor()`**: Positions another element relative to that anchor
- **`:has()` selector**: Detects state changes in child elements
- **CSS variables**: Used to dynamically switch between anchor targets

### Technical Implementation

**Final Working Code Structure:**

```css
/* Underline element that follows anchors */
.nav-links::before {
    content: '';
    position: absolute;
    left: anchor(var(--target) left);
    right: anchor(var(--target) right);
    bottom: anchor(var(--target) bottom);
    transition: all 0.3s;
    border-bottom: 0.2rem solid var(--foreground);
}

/* Hide when no links are hovered */
.nav-links:not(:has(a:hover, a:focus-visible))::before {
    visibility: hidden;
    opacity: 0;
}

/* Set anchor names on navigation items */
.nav-link a {
    anchor-name: var(--anchor);
}

/* Define anchor names for each item */
.nav-link:nth-child(1) {
    --anchor: --item-1;
}
.nav-link:nth-child(2) {
    --anchor: --item-2;
}

/* Set target when items are hovered */
.nav-links:has(.nav-link:nth-child(1) a:is(:hover, :focus-visible)) {
    --target: --item-1;
}
.nav-links:has(.nav-link:nth-child(2) a:is(:hover, :focus-visible)) {
    --target: --item-2;
}
```

### Debugging Process & Lessons Learned

**Major Issues Encountered:**

1. **CSS Variable Scope**: Initially `--target` wasn't being set due to incorrect `:has()` selector logic
2. **Selector Syntax**: Missing class prefixes and extra parentheses broke CSS parsing
3. **Hide Logic Error**: Original logic `has(a:not(:hover))` meant "hide if ANY link is not hovered" instead of "hide if NO links are hovered"
4. **Anchor Positioning Support**: Required Chrome 125+ with experimental flag enabled

**Browser Support Requirements:**

- **Chrome 125+** with "CSS Anchor Positioning" flag enabled in `chrome://flags`
- **Feature Detection**: `CSS.supports('left', 'anchor(--test left)')` returns `true` when supported
- **Not widely supported yet** - cutting-edge experimental feature

### Current Limitations

**Vertical Positioning Issues:**

- **Problem**: `left`/`right` anchor transitions work smoothly, but `bottom` anchor transitions are jumpy
- **Root Cause**: Different coordinate systems and reference points for vertical vs horizontal positioning
- **Known Limitation**: CSS Anchor Positioning vertical transitions are less reliable than horizontal ones
- **Workarounds**: Use `top` instead of `bottom`, or combine with `transform` for fine-tuning

### Key Learnings

1. **Experimental APIs**: Bleeding-edge features require extensive debugging and may have unexpected limitations
2. **Browser Flags**: Testing new features requires enabling experimental flags and specific browser versions
3. **CSS Logic Complexity**: Advanced selectors like `:has()` and `:not()` require careful logical thinking
4. **Fallback Planning**: Experimental features need robust fallback strategies for production use
5. **Reference Implementation**: Following official demos closely helps avoid syntax pitfalls

### Production Considerations

**Current Status:**
‚úÖ **Working** - Smooth horizontal underline animation
‚ö†Ô∏è **Partial** - Vertical positioning has transition issues
üî¨ **Experimental** - Requires browser flags, not production-ready

**Future Implementation:**

- Monitor browser support expansion
- Consider JavaScript fallback for production
- Explore alternative CSS-only solutions for broader compatibility
